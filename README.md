# Texture Synthesis and Style Transfer

![test](latex/files/assets/results/magali2.jpg?raw=true)

Undergraduate project of the Applied Mathematics course by the School of Applied Mathematics of FGV (FGV/EMAp).

This work is a study in the area of Texture Synthesis, with an implementation in PyTorch of the synthesis method 
and the style transfer using Convolutional Neural Networks.

All the codes are inside the ``python/`` directory and the main file is ``texture_synth.py``.
The instructions on how to change the code parameters are commented in this file. 
It is recommended to run the code in a Python IDEs like Spyder, which shows the result plot at each iteration.
